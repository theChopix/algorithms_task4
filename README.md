## Task

#### Buying totems in the African rainforest

Traveler Matthew Henson visits and indigenous tribe in the African rainforest. The tribes live in huts along the long river. Several huts form village, with each of the two neighboring villages separated by a totem pole built by ancient ancestors. The totems are unique and Mr. Henson is interested in buying them. He is convinced that each of them will sell to private collections for the price P. He learns from the natives that totems between pairs of neighboring villages stand to ensure a ceasefire and good neighborly relations between the inhabitants. However, the natives do not respect the ties of their ancestors very much and are willing to negotiate the sale of totems. If the number of warriors in two neighboring is the same, they even offer free totem that separates the villages, because they believe that the balance of power ensures good judicial relations. However, if there are more B1 warriors in one village and B2 in another, where B1 != B2, then they are more concerned and demand to pay the amount L for each warrior in which one of the villages is stronger than the other, the total amount L * | B1 - B2 |. When Mr. Henson obtains one of the totems, the boundaries between the two villages disappear at the same time and the two neighboring villages become one (the natives have a strong idea that the boundaries of the villages are defined by totems). Mr. Henson may continue to negotiate the purchase of additional totems, but must reckon with the fact that the number of villages and the number of warriors in the villages will change the with each closed trade. The question is how many totems and in what order to gradually buy in order to maximize the profit.

The numbers of warriors in each village along the river are given, as well as the amounts of P and L. Determine the maximum profit Mr. Henson can make if he buys some of the totems from the natives and then sells them to private collections at the price of P for each totem. Totems are purchased sequentally. Each individual trade must first be made and the totem removed, before it is possible to negotiate with the natives to buy another totem. The natives will not accept another format of trade.
